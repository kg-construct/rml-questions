# RML questions

Weâ€™re using [Discussions](https://github.com/kg-construct/rml-questions/discussions) 
as a place to answer questions about RML and its specification.
Questions that are specific to a certain RML processor should be asked in the processor's repo,
but questions about the language should be asked here.
Based on these questions we would like to also include relevant examples.

## Transfering existing issues

If an issue was already created in another repo,
it is possible to [transfer it](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository) to this repo.

## Add link to README of your processor

We advice to add a link to this repo in the README of your processor.
That way people will find this repo easier and 
will ask RML-specific questions immediately here.
