# RML questions

Weâ€™re using [Discussions](https://github.com/kg-construct/rml-questions/discussions) 
as a place to answer questions about RML and its specification.
Questions that are specific to a certain RML processor should be asked in the processor's repo,
but questions about the language should be asked here.
Based on these questions we would like to also include relevant examples.
